# Beaver Builder Class Dropdown
Adds user defined CSS classes to dropdown below the Beaver Builder class input in the Advanced tab

The settings for this plugin are located inside of Beaver Builder's settings, under the new Predefined Classes tab

![admin-panel](https://github.com/zackpyle/BBClassDropdown/assets/19413506/fa298823-8066-4215-ae22-f79b9aaac75b)


The groups and classes you define in the settings panel will then be displayed inside the builder in a dropdown below the class input in the Advanced tab

The little = icon next to the groups and classes let you drag/drop to reorder your groups and classes for your convenience. 

Below the predefined classes in the admin panel, there is a section to Import/Export Settings. It is useful when you have a default list of classes you like to use on every site (or as a starting point) - so you can create them once and import them into sites as you need.

The last and what I think is the **best** feature is you also have the ability to select if a group is a single class group - meaning, you only select one out of the group at a time. If you check this for the group, then in the dropdown, it will give you radio button looking symbols to let you know which class has been added aready. If you select another class, it will swap it for you. This is useful for things like background colors where you wouldn't have more than one of those classes at a time.
